The bunny benchmark is availble for many render engines and different
technologies like HTML5, Flash or native. Here are just a few implementations 
for the most popular HTML5 libraries. Please note that the performance numbers 
of this benchmark do not necessarily correspond with the performance in real 
world application since real world performance depend on many different factors.
